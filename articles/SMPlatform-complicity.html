        <h1>Social Media Complicit in Hiding Canon RAW Editing Vulnerability?</h1>
        <p class="meta">Platform Accountability | Security Disclosure</p>

        <h2>A Security Disclosure about legacy RAW CR2 Image hacking on social media gets deleted. The Question Is: Why?</h2>

        <p>Are we not allowed to expose vulnerabilities, frauds, scams, and Disinformation on social media platforms?</p>

        <p>Let's start by thanking these platforms for supporting bad actors, that's complicit by definition, and strengthens my case further.</p>

        <p>There's a vulnerability in how the world understands digital image authenticity. RAW files - the format photographers and forensic analysts trust as "uneditable proof" - can be fabricated from scratch. Not edited. <strong>Created</strong>.</p>

        <p>I built a tool to demonstrate this: <a href="https://cr2editor.web.app">https://cr2editor.web.app</a></p>

        <p>Within hours of posting about it on social media, my account was terminated. My communities were banned. My posts - containing forensic analysis, histograms, and scientific evidence - were erased.</p>

        <p><strong>No warning. No policy citation. No appeal.</strong></p>

        <h2>The Vulnerability</h2>

        <p>Camera RAW files (CR2, NEF, ARW) are treated as tamper-proof because they contain unprocessed sensor data. Courts accept them. Journalists trust them. The public believes "RAW = authentic."</p>

        <p><strong>This assumption is false.</strong></p>

        <p>Using techniques documented since 2016 (libraw, dcraw), anyone can:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Hollow out a legitimate CR2 file</li>
            <li>Insert a synthetic image (Photoshop, Blender)</li>
            <li>Produce a file that passes casual inspection</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The only forensic signature that exposes this fraud? <strong>Sensor noise analysis.</strong> Real cameras produce thermal noise, shot noise, read noise - a "noise floor" visible in histogram analysis. Synthetic insertions lack this floor entirely.</p>

        <h2>The Evidence That Was Deleted</h2>

        <p>My post contained forensic analysis of 19 suspicious cloud images. The findings:</p>

        <p><strong>Real Canon 5D Mark II histogram (14-bit):</strong></p>
        <img src="images/SMPlatform-004.png" alt="Real Canon 5D Mark II 14-bit histogram showing normal sensor noise distribution">

        <p><strong>Suspected fake (Jonas cloud image):</strong></p>
        <img src="images/SMPlatform-006.png" alt="Jonas fake cloud image histogram showing dead zone - zero pixels in noise floor">

        <p><strong>Zero pixels in the noise floor.</strong> A physical impossibility for a functioning sensor.</p>

        <p>The physics is simple: CMOS sensors are never silent. Thermal energy, electrical fluctuations, and photon shot noise guarantee activity even in complete darkness. A histogram showing absolute zero in these ranges means the sensor was never active. The image was inserted into a hollow container.</p>

        <p><strong>This is what I posted. This is what the platform deleted.</strong></p>

        <h2>The Disinformation Threat Model</h2>

        <p>Disinformation operations require three components:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Fabricated evidence</strong> - Images, documents, recordings that appear authentic</li>
            <li><strong>Distribution network</strong> - Platforms where content spreads</li>
            <li><strong>Suppression mechanism</strong> - Systems that silence anyone who exposes the fabrication</li>
        </ol>

        <p>RAW file forgery provides the fabricated evidence. Social media provides distribution. And when platforms delete forensic analysis exposing the methodology?</p>

        <p><strong>They become the suppression mechanism.</strong></p>

        <p>These platforms aren't neutral here. By deleting posts that explain <em>how</em> RAW files can be faked and <em>how</em> to detect fakes, they actively protect the operational model of disinformation campaigns.</p>

        <h2>The AI Training Problem</h2>

        <p>Major social media platforms license their data to AI companies. Every post, comment, and discussion feeds models that will shape how future systems understand truth, evidence, and authenticity.</p>

        <p>When platforms scrub forensic security research while leaving disinformation intact, they poison the training data. AI systems learn that certain technical discussions are "violations" while fabricated narratives are acceptable.</p>

        <p><strong>This isn't hypothetical. It's happening now.</strong></p>

        <h2>What I Posted (Before Deletion)</h2>

        <h3>Post 1: Forensic Analysis</h3>

        <blockquote>
            "Real camera raw files capture light data in a smooth, natural spread of values. Genuine photos never have big 'dead zones' (gaps with zero pixels). Jonas images show exactly that - entire 19 images show large dead zones, unnatural gaps and peaks - suggesting they're inserted synthetic images into a hollowed out CR2 container."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Post 2: Educational Tool</h3>

        <blockquote>
            "This EDUCATIONAL TOOL is to promote critical thinking and demonstrate how easily narrative disinformation can be manufactured."
            <br><br>
            <em>CR2 Creation App - 2016 scripts. Reproduced Jonas Cloud fakes 100%.</em>
            <br><br>
            <a href="https://cr2editor.web.app">https://cr2editor.web.app</a>
        </blockquote>

        <img src="images/SMPlatform-009.png" alt="CR2 Editor tool interface showing synthetic RAW file creation">

        <p>The tool at <a href="https://cr2editor.web.app">cr2editor.web.app</a> exists so anyone can verify this vulnerability themselves. Create a synthetic CR2. Examine its histogram. Compare to authentic camera output. The difference is unmistakable.</p>

        <p><strong>The platform's response? Termination. Community bans. Complete erasure.</strong></p>

        <h2>The Pattern</h2>

        <p>I created a new account. Posted once about CR2 research. Banned within minutes.</p>

        <p>This isn't spam filtering. This isn't community moderation. This is targeted suppression of specific technical content.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p class="question">What policy prohibits explaining that camera RAW files can be fabricated?</p>
            <p class="question">Who benefits from keeping this vulnerability hidden?</p>
            <p class="question">Why does forensic security research trigger instant termination while actual disinformation thrives?</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Verify It Yourself</h2>

        <p>The tool is live: <a href="https://cr2editor.web.app">https://cr2editor.web.app</a></p>

        <p>Upload a Photoshop image. Select a donor CR2. Generate a synthetic RAW file.</p>

        <p>Then examine the histogram. You'll see exactly what the scammers see - and exactly what they don't want you to understand.</p>

        <p><strong>RAW files are not proof. They never were. The only question is whether platforms will let you know that, or delete you for saying it.</strong></p>
